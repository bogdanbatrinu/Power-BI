🔹 Daily Power BI 6: Dataflows for Self-Service Data Prep

Power BI Dataflows is a powerful feature that enables self-service data preparation in the cloud. It allows users to create, manage, and reuse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes across different reports and dashboards—without requiring complex database management.

🛠 Key Features of Dataflows:
✅ No-Code Data Transformation: Use Power Query (same as Excel & Power BI Desktop) to clean and shape data.
✅ Centralized Data Storage: Store processed data in Azure Data Lake for easy access across multiple reports.
✅ Automated Refreshes: Schedule data updates to keep reports up-to-date.
✅ Reusable Data Entities: Save cleaned data as entities and share them across teams for consistency.
✅ Supports Large Datasets: Helps scale reporting solutions without overloading Power BI Desktop.
🔍 When to Use Dataflows?
🔹 When multiple reports need the same transformed dataset
🔹 If you want to store data in a centralized, cloud-based location
🔹 When you need reusable ETL processes without relying on IT

💡 Bonus Tip:
You can integrate Power BI Dataflows with Azure Synapse Analytics for even more advanced analytics and AI-driven insights!
