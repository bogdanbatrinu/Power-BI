Date Filtering & Slicers

Power BI makes it effortless to analyze time-based data using date filtering and slicers. Whether tracking modifications, sales trends, or historical changes, Power BI offers powerful date-based filtering capabilities.

🕵️ Why Use Date Filters in Power BI?
✅ Track changes over time (e.g., modified records, trends, etc.)
✅ Compare time periods (e.g., last month vs. this month)
✅ Analyze seasonal trends in sales, performance, or any KPI
✅ Automate dashboards by dynamically updating them based on current dates

🔹 How to Use Date Filters in Power BI

Power BI provides multiple ways to filter by date:
1️⃣ Using the Filter Pane
📌 Steps:
1️⃣ Open your report in Power BI Desktop
2️⃣ Select a visualization
3️⃣ In the Filters pane, drag a date field to the filter area
4️⃣ Choose a condition like:
After a specific date (ModifiedDate > '2000-12-29')
Between two dates
Relative filtering (Last 7 days, Last 3 months, etc.)
Adding a Date Slicer
📌 Steps:
1️⃣ Drag a date column into the report canvas
2️⃣ Select Slicer from the Visualizations pane
3️⃣ Use the slicer to dynamically filter your reports

📌 Bonus: Enable relative date filtering to always show data from the last week, month, or year automatically!

💡 Use Case: Modified Data Analysis
Imagine tracking customer record changes in Power BI using a date slicer. Simply link the ModifiedDate field from your database and filter updates after December 29, 2000—just like in SQL!

🔹 SQL Query for Power BI Data Source:

SELECT BusinessEntityID, FirstName, LastName, ModifiedDate 
FROM Person.Person 
WHERE ModifiedDate > '2000-12-29'

Once connected in Power BI, use date filters and slicers to analyze updates dynamically.
🚀 Pro Tip: Combine Date Filtering with Time Intelligence Functions
Pair date filters with Power BI's built-in Time Intelligence functions like:
✔️ TOTALYTD() – Year-to-date calculations
✔️ PREVIOUSMONTH() – Compare last month's data
✔️ DATEADD() – Shift between time periods
