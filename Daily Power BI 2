📊 Daily Power BI 2: Creating a Product List Table

Today’s Power BI exercise focuses on listing product details using Power Query and DAX.

🔹 Using Power Query to Load Product Data

If you have a dataset with product details (e.g., Products table), follow these steps to import and transform it:

1️⃣ Open Power BI Desktop
2️⃣ Click on “Transform Data” to open Power Query Editor
3️⃣ Select your data source (Excel, SQL Server, CSV, etc.)
4️⃣ Filter the columns you need:
 • Product Name
 • Product Number
 • Color

5️⃣ Click “Close & Apply” to load the data into Power BI

🔹 Creating a Table Visual for Product Details

Once the data is loaded, create a table visualization to display product details:

1️⃣ Go to Report View
2️⃣ Click on Table Visual
3️⃣ Drag and drop:
 • Product Name
 • Product Number
 • Color

🎨 Enhance your table:
✅ Format columns with colors & alignment
✅ Use conditional formatting to highlight products with missing colors

🔹 DAX Formula for Custom Product Categories

Want to classify products based on color availability? Use this DAX formula:

ProductCategory = 
IF(
 ISBLANK(Products[Color]), 
 "Uncategorized", 
 "Classified"
)

🔹 Add this column to the table visual to see categorized products!

💡 Pro Tip:

📌 Use Filters & Slicers to explore product data interactively.
📌 Apply Data Bars to visually highlight product numbers in your table.
