Report Page Tooltips in Power BI

This allows you to create detailed, interactive tooltips that display additional insights without cluttering your main report canvas. By designing a dedicated tooltip page, you can provide users with contextual information and deeper analysis upon hovering over data points. This approach not only enriches the user experience but also maintains a clean and organized report layout. 

Steps to Implement Report Page Tooltips

Create a Tooltip Page:
In Power BI Desktop, add a new page to your report.
Navigate to the "Format" pane, select "Page Information," and toggle on the "Tooltip" option.
Set the page size appropriately under "Canvas settings" to ensure it fits as a tooltip.

Design the Tooltip:

Add visuals and information that provide context or additional details relevant to the main report.
Ensure the visuals are concise and enhance the user's understanding of the data point they are hovering over.

Assign the Tooltip to a Visual:

Return to your main report page.
Select the visual where you want to implement the tooltip.
In the "Format" pane, expand the "Tooltip" section.
Set the "Type" to "Report page" and choose your newly created tooltip page from the dropdown menu.

By following these steps, you can create dynamic tooltips that enhance data interactivity and provide users with a richer analytical experience.
